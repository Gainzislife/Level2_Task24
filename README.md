# Project management system

It is to keep track of projects a company works on.

Some of the functionality:
- Add new projects that can auto-name if needed.
- Update information about existing projects.
- Generate an invoice for a project.
- View all the projects and/or with certain specifications like: past due, finalised, or incomplete.
- Search for projects by name.

It makes use of textfiles to save all the data.

## Purpose
To demonstrate my understanding of how functions, methods, classes, and textfiles work together.
